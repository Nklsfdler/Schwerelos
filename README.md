# Schwerelos Project Setup

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system.
- One of the following package managers: `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.

## Installation
The project dependencies are currently **missing**. You must install them for the application to work and for IDE errors to disappear.

Run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

## Running the Development Server
Once dependencies are installed, start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
